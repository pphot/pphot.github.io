I used to be frustrated with Harry in this book. He yells. He's angry all the time. He makes terrible decisions.

Re-reading as an adult, I get it. This is what trauma looks like. He watched someone die. No one believes him about Voldemort. The Ministry is calling him a liar. The newspaper is destroying him. And he's stuck with the Dursleys all summer while his friends had each other.

The capslock shouting? That's not bad writing. That's a fifteen-year-old breaking under impossible pressure with no one to talk to.

## Dolores Umbridge: The Real Monster

Voldemort is scary. Umbridge makes your blood boil because we've all met her. She's every petty authority figure who abuses power because they can. Every bureaucrat who values rules over people.

The blood quill - forcing Harry to carve "I must not tell lies" into his own skin - is torture. Small, bureaucratic, deniable torture. And she gets away with it because she has the right paperwork.

## Dumbledore's Army

The DA is where the book finds hope. Teenagers taking their education into their own hands because adults have failed them. Harry becoming a teacher. Neville finding his courage.

The Room of Requirement giving them exactly what they need is magic at its best - space to grow when the world tries to limit you.

## Sirius Dies

The Department of Mysteries battle is chaos. The kids are outmatched. Then Dumbledore arrives and you think it'll be okay.

And then Sirius falls through the veil. Just... gone. No last words. No goodbye. Harry's scream, silenced by magic, is the most painful moment in the series.

The prophecy reveals Harry and Voldemort are bound together. But the twist is it only matters because Voldemort believed it. He created his own enemy by trying to prevent the prophecy.

_Rating: 8.5/10_

_Too long, occasionally drags, but emotionally necessary. This is where Harry becomes truly real to me._ 🔮
