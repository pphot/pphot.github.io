This is where the series stops being children's books. Someone dies. Voldemort returns. And suddenly magic isn't just fun and games - it's dangerous and deadly.

I remember reading this at 3 AM when I was fourteen, unable to stop even though I had school the next day. The Triwizard Tournament hooks you with spectacle, but underneath it all is a trap years in the making.

## A Tournament Built on Lies

Three schools. Three champions. Except Harry's name comes out of the Goblet even though he's too young and didn't enter. The whole year becomes Harry proving he didn't cheat while everyone doubts him.

What hurts most is Ron not believing him. Your best friend thinking you lied. That cuts deeper than any dragon.

The tasks themselves are brilliant - dragons, underwater rescue, a massive maze. Each one pushes Harry beyond what he thought possible. But we don't realize until too late that the tournament was never about glory. It was about getting Harry to touch a portkey at exactly the right moment.

## Teenage Problems Feel Real

The Yule Ball section is painfully, hilariously accurate. Harry and Ron waiting until the last minute to find dates. Getting rejected. Harry stepping on his partner's feet. Ron being jealous about Hermione and Viktor Krum.

It's such a perfect break from the darkness - just teenagers being disasters at a school dance.

## The Graveyard

Cedric's death still shocks me. "Kill the spare" - so casual, so meaningless. He dies just for being there. The resurrection ritual with bone, flesh, and blood. Voldemort rising from the cauldron.

Then Harry's parents appear through the wand connection, giving him precious seconds to escape. Reading this as a kid, I understood for the first time that this series wasn't going to have easy answers. People die. Even good people.

Harry bringing Cedric's body back is his first real act of courage - he could have run, but he doesn't leave Cedric behind.

## Mad-Eye Was Never Mad-Eye

The reveal that Moody was Barty Crouch Jr. all year is masterful. Every lesson, every conversation was manipulation. He was protecting Harry just enough to make sure Harry would reach the cup alive.

The polyjuice potion wearing off - Moody transforming into a young Death Eater - is genuinely horrifying.

_Rating: 9/10_

_The middle drags slightly, but the final act is worth every page. This is where childhood ends._ ⚡️
