This morning I woke up early – not because of an alarm, but because my body was ready. The light was soft and gray, the kind of light that makes you want to move slowly and speak quietly.

I made tea instead of coffee. Green tea with jasmine. I sat at my kitchen table and watched steam rise from the cup, curling and disappearing into the air.

No phone. No music. Just tea and silence and the sound of birds waking up outside.

I think this is what they mean by mindfulness – not meditating cross-legged on a cushion, but just being fully present for a cup of tea. Noticing the warmth of the cup in your hands. The slight bitterness on your tongue. The way your shoulders relax as you sit and sip.

It's a small thing, a slow morning with tea. But it made the whole day feel different. Softer. More spacious. More like living and less like rushing.

Maybe I'll make this a ritual. Maybe this is how I want to start my days. 🍵
