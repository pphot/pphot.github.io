There are books that feel like medicine for the soul. The Secret Garden is one of them. I read it first as a child and loved the mystery of the hidden garden. Reading it as an adult, I understand it's really about grief, healing, and how nature can bring us back to life.

## Mary: The Unloved Child

Mary Lennox is one of the most unlikeable protagonists in children's literature - and that's what makes her real. She starts the book spoiled, selfish, sour-faced, and thoroughly unpleasant. Her parents ignored her, servants did everything for her, and she's never had to care about anyone or anything.

Then her parents die in a cholera epidemic, and she's sent to her uncle's manor in Yorkshire - a huge, lonely house on the moors where she knows no one and nothing.

Burnett doesn't sugarcoat Mary's character. She's genuinely difficult. But she also shows us why: unloved children become unloving. Neglected children don't know how to connect. Mary's nastiness is armor built from years of being unwanted.

Watching her slowly transform - learning to care about a robin, about Dickon, about Colin, about the garden - is one of the most satisfying character arcs in literature.

## The Garden: Locked and Forgotten

Mary discovers that there's a garden, locked for ten years since her aunt died there. No one goes in. No one speaks of it. It's forbidden, forgotten, left to die.

The garden is, of course, a metaphor. It's her uncle's grief, locked away. It's Colin's illness, left to fester in isolation. It's Mary's own capacity for love, buried under years of neglect.

But gardens don't really die. Even ten years locked away, the garden has roses still alive, seeds waiting to sprout, life dormant but not dead. It just needs someone to care for it, to tend it, to bring it back to life.

## Dickon: Wild and Alive

Dickon is everything Mary isn't at the start: connected to nature, loved and loving, alive in a way that seems almost magical. He talks to animals, understands plants, moves through the world with ease and joy.

He's not a realistic character - he's an ideal, a representation of what humans could be if we stayed connected to the natural world. Some readers find him too perfect, but I think that's the point. He shows Mary (and Colin, and us) what health looks like.

Through Dickon, Mary learns that love isn't about being served - it's about service. He teaches her to garden, to observe, to care. He treats her like she's already good, and slowly she becomes so.

## Colin: The Invalid

Colin is Mary's cousin, hidden away in a locked room because he's convinced he's dying. He's selfish, spoiled, tyrannical - essentially Mary at the beginning, but worse because he's been coddled in his illness.

His father can't bear to look at him (he reminds him of his dead wife). The servants fear his tantrums. The doctor encourages his hypochondria. Everyone treats him as if he's dying, so he acts like he is.

Mary, fresh from her own transformation, refuses to accept Colin's narrative. She's mean to him in the way that only another child can be: "You're not dying, you're just being dramatic."

And she's right. Colin's illness is real - but it's been made worse by isolation, by fear, by everyone confirming his worst beliefs about himself. He doesn't need more pity. He needs someone to challenge him, to expect better from him.

## Magic: Nature's Healing Power

The children call it "Magic" - the force that makes things grow, that heals, that brings life from death. Dickon knew about it all along. Mary discovers it in the garden. Colin learns it last, but once he understands, he becomes its prophet.

"The Magic is in me! The Magic is in me!" he chants, making himself stand, making himself walk, making himself well through belief and fresh air and purpose.

It sounds like nonsense, but there's deep truth here. The mind affects the body. Belief matters. Connection to nature heals. Purpose gives strength. These aren't magical ideas - they're medical facts that we keep forgetting.

## The Transformation

The genius of this book is that everyone heals together. Mary heals Colin, but Colin also heals Mary by giving her someone to care about. Dickon heals both of them with his knowledge and patience. The garden heals all of them by giving them a purpose, a secret, a living thing to tend.

And through the children healing, the uncle heals too. The garden reopening is his grief unlocking. Colin getting well is him finding hope again. The ending, where he returns and finds his son alive and well, is about a man who's been dead inside learning to live again.

## The Yorkshire Moor

The setting is crucial. The moor is harsh, windswept, seemingly barren - but it's alive with its own beauty. It teaches the children (and us) that life exists in unexpected places, that what seems dead might just be dormant, that spring always comes even after the longest winter.

Burnett's descriptions of the moor changing with seasons are some of the most beautiful nature writing in children's literature. You can feel the wind, smell the heather, hear the skylark singing.

## Why This Book Endures

It's over 100 years old, and some attitudes are dated (the class dynamics, some of the dialect). But the core truths remain:

- Unloved children can learn to love if someone shows them how
- Nature heals in ways medicine can't
- Isolation makes suffering worse; connection makes healing possible
- What seems dead often just needs attention to bloom again
- Children are capable of profound wisdom and change

## What It Taught Me (Then and Now)

As a child: Gardens are magic, secrets are exciting, and even mean people can become nice.

As an adult: Grief needs to be tended, not locked away. Healing happens in community, not isolation. Nature isn't just pretty - it's medicine. The things we neglect don't die; they wait for us to return and care for them again.

Also: Fresh air, physical work, and purpose are better than most treatments for depression and anxiety. The Victorians somehow knew this, and we keep forgetting.

## A Book for Difficult Times

When I'm sad or stuck or feeling hopeless, I reread this book. It reminds me that spring comes, that growth is possible, that what feels dead might just be dormant. That I might need to get my hands dirty, work in the earth, let nature work its magic.

It's a gentle book, a patient book. It doesn't rush healing. It shows seasons passing, work being done, small changes accumulating into transformation.

_Rating: 9/10_

_A healing book about healing. Perfect for when you need to remember that growth is possible, that life persists, that even locked gardens can bloom again._ 🌹🗝️
