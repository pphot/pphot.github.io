November light has a quality I can't quite describe. It's softer than summer, more golden, like the world is being photographed through a warm filter. Today I walked for two hours through the park near my apartment, and I think I finally understand why autumn is my favorite season.

## The Color Palette

Everything is rust and amber and ochre. The leaves aren't just "brown" – they're copper and bronze and burnt sienna. They're wine-dark and sunset-orange and the pale yellow of old paper. The light catches them from behind and they glow like stained glass.

I've been trying to photograph this for years, but cameras can't quite capture it. The warmth, the depth, the way a single leaf can contain five different shades of gold. Maybe that's okay. Maybe some things are meant to be experienced, not documented.

## Walking Meditation

I wasn't trying to meditate, but somewhere around the one-hour mark, my mind went quiet. No music in my ears, no podcast, no phone. Just the crunch of leaves underfoot and the rustle of wind through branches and the distant sound of children playing.

My thoughts slowed down to match my pace. Instead of the usual mental chatter – the to-do lists and worries and replaying of conversations – there was just observation. That tree. This path. Those birds.

I read somewhere that the Japanese have a practice called "forest bathing" – not actual bathing, but the idea of immersing yourself in nature to reduce stress. I think I accidentally forest-bathed for two hours today, and I feel wrung out in the best way, like after a good cry or a long swim.

## What Autumn Teaches

There's something profound about watching leaves let go. They don't cling to the branch. When it's time, they fall – gracefully, inevitably, making way for new growth that will come in spring.

I'm not usually one for nature metaphors about life (they can feel trite), but standing under a oak tree watching hundreds of leaves spiral down, I felt it: the wisdom of letting go. Of trusting that what falls away makes space for what's coming next.

I've been holding onto things that have run their course. A friendship that's more habit than connection. A project I'm forcing instead of feeling inspired by. Habits that served me once but don't anymore. Maybe it's time to let them fall, to trust the cycle, to make space.

## The Temperature

It's that perfect autumn temperature where you need a jacket but not a coat. Where your breath might mist a little in the early morning but by noon you're warm in the sun. Where being outside feels comfortable instead of something to endure.

I saw an old couple on a bench, holding hands, not talking. Just sitting in the golden light. I wanted to be them in forty years – still finding beauty in ordinary afternoons, still choosing to sit outside and watch the light change.

## Photography Attempts

I gave up trying to capture it "right" and just started taking photos of whatever caught my eye. A single red leaf on wet pavement. The shadow pattern of bare branches. Light streaming through trees in visible rays.

Most of the photos aren't technically good. The exposure is off, the composition is casual, they're not Instagram-worthy. But they're true to how the walk felt – unhurried, observant, present.

Maybe that's what I'm learning: not everything needs to be perfect or shareable. Some experiences are just for you, and the photos are just reminders for your future self of how this felt, this day, this light.

## Coming Home

After two hours, I came home with cold fingers and warm cheeks, leaves stuck to my shoes, and a sense of peace I haven't felt in weeks. Sometimes the prescription for what ails you is simpler than you think: put on your jacket, go outside, walk until your mind quiets.

I'm writing this with tea, watching the light fade outside my window. Tomorrow I'll probably be back in the rush of regular life, but right now I'm holding onto this feeling – this autumn-light, leaf-crunching, thought-quieting peace.

_Do you have a favorite season? What does it teach you?_ 🍂
