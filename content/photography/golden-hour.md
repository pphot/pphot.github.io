There's something sacred about golden hour. That fleeting moment when the sun hangs low, painting the world in warm amber and honey tones. These photographs celebrate that magic – the way ordinary scenes become extraordinary when touched by this special light.

From city streets to coastal cliffs, from quiet forests to bustling markets, golden hour transforms everything it touches. This collection captures moments across different places and seasons, all united by that unmistakable warmth.

*Equipment: Canon EOS R6, 24-70mm f/2.8*

*"Light makes photography. Embrace light. Admire it. Love it. But above all, know light." – George Eastman*
