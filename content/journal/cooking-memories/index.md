I made my grandmother's spring rolls today. My hands remembered the motions before my brain did – the way to soften the rice paper, how tightly to roll, when to stop filling so it doesn't burst. She's been gone for five years, but in my kitchen this afternoon, she was right there with me.

## The Recipe That Isn't Written Down

There is no written recipe. I've tried to document it, but something essential gets lost in translation from memory to paper. "Add fish sauce until it tastes right" – but what is "right"? "The filling should be moist but not wet" – how do you measure that?

The real recipe lives in my hands, in muscle memory built over dozens of afternoons in her kitchen. She never measured anything. A handful of this, a pinch of that, taste and adjust. Cooking as intuition, not instruction.

## Kitchen as Classroom

I didn't realize at the time that those afternoons were lessons. I thought I was just keeping her company, being underfoot, sneaking bites of filling. But she was teaching me without teaching, showing me without explaining.

How to test if oil is hot enough (drop in a small piece of rice paper – if it sizzles immediately, it's ready). How to tell when vegetables are properly salted (they'll weep a little water). How to balance flavors (sweet, salty, sour, umami – each dish needs all four in harmony).

More than techniques, she was teaching me patience. Cooking her way takes time. You can't rush the marinating, can't skip the prep, can't microwave what should be steamed. The slow way is the right way.

## Food as Love Language

My grandmother wasn't effusive with words. She didn't say "I love you" in Vietnamese or English. But she said it in summer rolls packed for my lunch. In the special dishes she'd make when I visited. In the way she'd watch me eat, satisfied smile crinkling her eyes when I reached for seconds.

I understand now that feeding people was how she showed love. And learning to cook her recipes is how I keep loving her, how I keep her alive.

## The Missing Ingredient

Today's spring rolls were good. Maybe even great. But they weren't quite right. Something was missing that I can't identify or replicate. Maybe it's the missing ingredient in all inherited recipes – the hands that made them first, the kitchen they were born in, the love that seasoned them.

Or maybe I'm being too sentimental, and they just need a bit more sugar.

## Passing It Forward

I don't have children to pass these recipes to. But I teach them to friends who ask, to anyone willing to spend an afternoon in my kitchen learning the way I learned – by doing, by tasting, by feeling when it's right.

Last month, my friend Emma made them for her family. She sent me a photo: imperfect rolls, some split at the seams, filling peeking through. "They're ugly but delicious!" her text said.

I showed the photo to my phone's photo of my grandmother (yes, I talk to her photo sometimes, don't judge). "She's learning," I told her. "Just like I did."

## What I'm Really Making

When I make these spring rolls, I'm not just making food. I'm making connection across time and distance. I'm making my grandmother's kitchen exist again, just for an afternoon. I'm making memory edible.

I'm making proof that love doesn't end when people do. It changes form, becomes recipe and ritual, technique and tradition. It lives in how I hold the rice paper, in the ratio of herbs to pork, in the patience I learned from watching her hands work.

## Today's Batch

The spring rolls are cooling on a plate lined with paper towels, exactly like she used to do. I'll eat some now, save some for tomorrow (they're even better cold from the fridge), and freeze some for later when I need to remember where I come from.

Tomorrow I might make her claypot fish. Or her caramelized pork belly. Or her bitter melon soup that I hated as a child but crave as an adult. 

Each recipe is a door to her kitchen, a way to spend another afternoon together. And as long as I can cook what she taught me, she's not really gone.
