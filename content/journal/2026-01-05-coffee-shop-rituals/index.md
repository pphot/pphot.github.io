There's something sacred about the morning ritual of finding a coffee shop in a new place. Not the chain ones with their identical interiors and predictable menus, but the local spots where the barista nods at regulars and the espresso machine hisses its familiar song.

## The Search for "My Spot"

Whenever I arrive somewhere new – whether for a week or a month – my first mission is finding "my coffee shop." Not just any café will do. I'm looking for something specific, though I couldn't have articulated what until recently: I'm looking for a place that feels like coming home, even though I've never been there before.

In Lisbon, it was a tiny place near Alfama where the owner, a woman in her seventies, made each coffee with the concentration of a surgeon. She never smiled, but she remembered everyone's order by the second visit. That was three years ago, and I still think about her cortado – strong, perfectly balanced, served in a cup she hand-washed between customers.

## More Than Just Coffee

These aren't just places to get caffeine. They're observation posts, writing studios, social laboratories. I've learned more about cities from their coffee shops than from any guidebook.

The way people greet each other. The newspaper they read. Whether they come alone with a book or in groups of friends. How long they linger. Whether tipping is expected or unusual. What time the morning rush happens and what that says about the local work culture.

## The Regular's Privilege

There's a particular joy in becoming a regular, even temporarily. The third morning when the barista starts making your drink as soon as you walk in. The week when she saves you your favorite table. The moment she asks if you want "the usual" and you realize yes, you have a usual here now, you belong to this small corner of the world for this brief moment in time.

It's a shallow belonging, I know. I'm a tourist pretending to be local. But it doesn't feel fake. It feels like connection, however temporary. Like dropping an anchor, however light, into a place.

## What I'm Really Looking For

I think what I'm seeking in these coffee shops is continuity. My life is full of change – new cities, new faces, new languages, new everything. But the ritual of morning coffee is constant. The smell of espresso, the weight of a ceramic cup, the first bitter sip – these are the same whether I'm in Lisbon or Paris or Porto.

It's my way of creating home wherever I am. Not home as a place, but home as a practice. Home as the thing you do every morning that tells you who you are and that you're okay.

## Today's Coffee

This morning I'm writing this from a café in my own neighborhood, where I've been a regular for two years. The barista – his name is Marco – brought me my flat white without my asking and added a small pastry to the saucer "because you look like you need something sweet today."

He was right. I did need something sweet today.

Maybe that's the real gift of these places. Not just the coffee, but the way they create space for small kindnesses, for recognition, for the simple human pleasure of being known and welcomed.
