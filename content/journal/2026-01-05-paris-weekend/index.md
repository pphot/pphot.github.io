There's something enchanting about Paris that never fades, no matter how many times you visit. This past weekend, I found myself wandering through Montmartre just as the golden hour painted everything in warm amber tones. The Sacré-Cœur gleamed white against a peach-colored sky, and for a moment, I forgot about everything except the beauty unfolding before me.

## The Magic of Getting Lost

I've learned that the best moments happen when I put away the map and simply follow my curiosity. This trip was no exception. After my third café crème at a tiny spot on Rue Lepic – where the barista now recognized me and added an extra croissant to my order with a knowing smile – I decided to wander without direction.

That's when I found it: a narrow alleyway I'd walked past a dozen times before, but never down. The afternoon light was slanting through the buildings at just the right angle, creating these dramatic shadows on the cobblestones. At the end of the street stood a small boulangerie, its windows fogged with warmth, the scent of fresh bread so intoxicating I could almost taste it.

Inside, an elderly woman with flour-dusted hands sold me a still-warm baguette. She spoke no English; I speak terrible French. But somehow, through gestures and smiles, she told me about her grandmother who started this bakery in 1952. I left with bread, butter, and a story I'll carry forever.

The afternoon stretched long and golden. I found myself in the gardens of Musée Rodin, sitting on a bench with my sketchbook open but mostly forgotten. The Thinker brooded nearby while couples sprawled on the grass, sharing wine and cheese and easy laughter. Children chased pigeons in that timeless way children do, shrieking with delight each time the birds scattered and regrouped.

There's a particular kind of peace that comes from being surrounded by beauty – both natural and created. The roses were in their late bloom, petals just beginning to drop, which somehow made them more beautiful. I sketched one that had fallen on my bench, its edges browning but its center still vivid pink.

## An Unexpected Conversation

As the light began to fade, an older gentleman sat down beside me. He was probably in his seventies, distinguished in that effortlessly French way – pressed shirt, well-worn leather satchel, silver hair that looked intentionally tousled.

"You are drawing the roses," he observed in accented English. "They are more beautiful when they are dying, no?"

We talked for nearly an hour. His name was Philippe, and he'd been coming to this garden every Saturday for forty-three years – first with his wife before she passed, now alone with his memories and a book of poetry. He told me that tourists always photograph the sculptures, but rarely notice the gardens. "This," he said, gesturing to the roses, "this is also art."

He recommended a wine bar in the Marais that doesn't appear in any guidebook, where the owner's sister makes the best ratatouille in Paris. I wrote the address in my journal, knowing I'd probably never find it, but treasuring the recommendation nonetheless.

## The Sounds of Evening

As dusk settled over the city, I made my way along the Seine. The booksellers were packing up their stalls, and the riverbanks filled with locals claiming spots for the evening. I bought a cheap bottle of rosé from a corner shop and joined them, sitting on the stone steps with my feet dangling toward the water.

An accordion player set up nearby – not for tourists, but seemingly for himself. He played old French songs I didn't know but somehow recognized in my bones. A couple beside me swayed gently, her head on his shoulder. Across the river, the lights of Notre-Dame reflected in the darkening water, and I felt that peculiar mixture of contentment and longing that only Paris seems to evoke.

I thought about all the lives being lived around me. The couple going home to cook dinner. The accordion player packing up his instrument. Philippe returning to his apartment with its memories. The baker cleaning flour from her hands. All of us orbiting through this beautiful, impossible city, our stories briefly intersecting before spinning apart again.

## Lessons from the Road

Travel has taught me that the best stories often come from the unplanned moments. Not the famous monuments or carefully curated museum visits, but the conversations with strangers who become friends for an afternoon. The wrong turns that lead to hidden gardens. The quiet observations that shift your perspective just enough to see your own life differently.

I've stopped trying to "do" cities. Instead, I try to breathe them in. To move slowly enough that they can reveal themselves. To say yes to invitations, even when they're unspoken. To trust that getting lost is often the best way to find what you're really looking for.

## Going Home

As I sipped my final café au lait the next morning before heading to Gare du Nord, I watched the city wake up. Shopkeepers rolling up metal shutters. Students hurrying to early classes. The same elderly man I'd seen both mornings buying his newspaper from the same kiosk.

I realized that Paris hadn't changed. I had. Again. The city has this way of holding up a mirror, showing you not just who you are, but who you might become. It reminded me to notice the roses before they fade. To talk to strangers. To follow the light even when I don't know where it leads.

My train ticket sat in my pocket, and my bag waited by the door. But part of me was already planning the next visit – not to see more, but to see deeper. To find that wine bar Philippe mentioned. To bring bread from the bakery on the hidden street. To sit in Rodin's garden and sketch the roses.

_Until next time, Paris. À bientôt._ ✨
