I've read The Little Prince at least five times in my life, and each time it's a different book. At ten, it was a strange story about a boy and a fox. At twenty, it was about lost innocence. At thirty, it's about love and loss and the things we can only see with our hearts.

This tiny book - barely 100 pages - contains more wisdom than most thousand-page novels.

## A Strange Little Visitor

The story begins with a pilot stranded in the Sahara Desert who meets a little prince from asteroid B-612. The prince has golden hair, a scarf that waves in the wind, and questions that cut straight to the heart of things.

He's traveled from planet to planet, meeting strange adults: a king who rules nothing, a conceited man who hears only praise, a businessman who counts stars he thinks he owns, a lamplighter who follows orders without questioning.

Each one is ridiculous. Each one is us.

## The Rose

On his tiny planet, the prince had a rose. She was vain, demanding, difficult. She made him miserable with her mood swings and her needs. So he left her.

But traveling through the universe, meeting thousands of roses in a garden, he realizes something: his rose is unique. Not because she's more beautiful - she isn't. But because she's *his*. Because he watered her. Protected her. Listened to her complaints. Loved her.

"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."

That line broke me the first time I read it. It still does. Love isn't about finding the perfect person. It's about choosing someone and then making them matter through your care and attention.

## The Fox and Taming

The prince meets a fox who wants to be tamed. "What does tamed mean?" asks the prince.

"It means to establish ties," says the fox. "If you tame me, we shall need each other. You will be unique in the world to me. I shall be unique in the world to you."

But taming means opening yourself to pain. The fox knows that when the prince leaves, he'll be sad. Still, he asks to be tamed, because the golden wheat will remind him of the prince's golden hair, and that will be a gift.

This is what love costs: the certainty of eventual pain. But it's also what makes life meaningful - those ties, those connections, those people who become unique to us.

## What Matters Is Invisible

"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."

The most important things in life can't be seen or measured or counted. Love. Friendship. Beauty. Meaning. These exist in the invisible realm, the realm of connection and feeling.

Adults forget this. We get obsessed with numbers - salaries, square footage, likes, followers. We think these visible, countable things are what matter. But they're not. They're just measurements of the surface.

The essential things live deeper, where only the heart can reach.

## The Drawings

The book begins with the narrator's childhood drawing of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant - but adults only see a hat. They tell him to stop drawing and study geography instead.

This is what happens to all of us. We start seeing magic - snakes that eat elephants, stars that laugh, flowers that talk. Adults tell us to be practical, to see things as they "really" are.

But the narrator never forgot his drawing. And when the little prince asks him to draw a sheep, he draws boxes with holes until the prince is satisfied with a sheep inside.

Sometimes the most important things are the ones we can't see. Sometimes imagination is more true than reality.

## The Lamplighter

Of all the adults the prince meets, he only respects the lamplighter - the man who lights and extinguishes a streetlamp every minute because his planet spins so fast.

"He is the only one who does not seem ridiculous to me. Perhaps because he is thinking of something other than himself."

The lamplighter is faithful to his duty even when it's absurd, even when no one sees or cares. There's something beautiful in that dedication, that service, that thinking beyond yourself.

## The Snake

The ending is heartbreaking and beautiful. The prince needs to return to his rose, but his body is too heavy for the journey. So a snake helps him - with a bite that will let him leave his body behind.

Is it death? Is it transformation? Is it going home? Saint-Exupéry leaves it ambiguous, but the message is clear: sometimes we have to let go of the form to reach what matters.

The prince tells the pilot to look at the stars and remember him laughing. That's all we leave behind - memories in the hearts of those who loved us.

## Why Children's Books Hit Harder as Adults

This book is marketed for children but written for adults who have forgotten how to be children. Kids understand it intuitively - the importance of imagination, the reality of invisible things, the value of what you love simply because it's yours.

Adults have to relearn these lessons. We've been trained to dismiss them as childish, impractical, naive. But reading this book reminds us: we're the ones who lost something important. Children still have it.

## What This Book Taught Me

First reading (age 10): It's a weird story about a boy and some planets.

Second reading (age 20): It's about how adults lose their ability to see magic.

Third reading (age 30): It's about love and responsibility. About how the things we care for become unique through our attention. About how the essential is invisible. About how we all need to be tamed - to form ties, to need each other, to become important to someone.

Now: It's about all of that and more. It's about mortality, about legacy, about what we leave behind. About the cost of love and why it's worth paying.

## The Dedication

The book is dedicated to Saint-Exupéry's friend Léon Werth, "when he was a little boy."

We're all little once. We all understood important things before we learned to dismiss them as childish. This book is an invitation to remember, to return, to see with the heart again.

## Who Should Read This

Everyone. Seriously.

If you're young, it will plant seeds that will bloom later.  
If you're older, it will remind you of what you knew once and forgot.  
If you're in love, it will help you understand why they're unique to you.  
If you've lost someone, it will help you see them in the stars.

It's a book to return to over and over, at different ages, different seasons of life. It will always have something new to say because you'll be different each time you read it.

_Rating: 10/10_

_A perfect book. Simple, profound, heartbreaking, and essential. Read it once as a child, again as an adult, and once more when you need to remember what matters._ ⭐🦊
