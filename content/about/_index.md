## Hello, I'm Pphot

I'm a storyteller, a wanderer, and a seeker of beauty in the everyday. But I didn't start out that way.

Five years ago, I was working a job that paid well but hollowed me out from the inside. I spent my days in meetings about meetings, my creativity channeled into PowerPoint presentations nobody read. I dreamed about quitting, traveling, doing something meaningful – but like most people, I filed those dreams under "someday."

Then my grandfather died. At his funeral, person after person spoke about how he'd lived fully, loved deeply, taken risks. He'd been a fisherman, a carpenter, a painter, a storyteller. He'd built his own house, grown his own food, traveled to places that weren't on maps. He'd lived.

I realized I wasn't living. I was existing, waiting for life to start while it was already happening.

Six months later, I quit my job, bought a camera and a one-way ticket to Portugal. I had no plan beyond "go" and "pay attention." That trip changed everything.

### Finding My Voice

What started as a simple travel blog evolved into something more – a space to explore not just places, but ideas, emotions, the human experience through literature and visual art. I discovered that the same attentiveness I was learning to bring to photography also changed how I read books, how I experienced new places, how I lived my daily life.

### What You'll Find Here

**Travel Journals** – Real stories from real places. No filters, just honest reflections on the adventures that shape us. I write about the experiences that changed me, the people I met, the lessons I'm still learning. You'll find detailed narratives about getting lost in Montmartre, eating sardines with Portuguese fishermen, stumbling into fado performances that made time stop.

**Book Reviews** – Literature has a way of changing how we see the world. I share in-depth thoughts on books that have moved me, challenged me, and stayed with me long after the last page. From contemporary fiction that explores the weight of our choices to Indigenous wisdom that reconnects us to the earth, I read widely and reflect deeply.

### My Philosophy

I believe that beauty is abundant and free, that the best stories come from being present enough to recognize them, and that the examined life is worth the effort of examination.

I believe in slow travel that prioritizes depth over breadth, in reading books that challenge rather than comfort, in taking photographs that capture feeling as much as image.

I believe we're all storytellers, whether we write our stories down or not. Every choice we make, every place we go, every book we read becomes part of the narrative we're crafting.

And I believe that sharing our stories – vulnerably, authentically – is how we connect across the distances that separate us.

### Behind the Camera

I shoot primarily with a Canon EOS R6, though I started with a second-hand Canon Rebel that I bought on Craigslist and learned on through sheer trial and error. I believe the best camera is the one you have with you, and some of my favorite images were captured on my phone.

I'm entirely self-taught, which means I've made every mistake possible and probably invented a few new ones. But it also means I learned to trust my eye and my instincts rather than following rules.

I'm drawn to natural light, authentic moments, and stories told through images. I'd rather capture one meaningful shot than a hundred technically perfect but soulless ones.

### The Life Now

These days, I split my time between longer travel adventures and periods at home where I write, process photos, and plan the next journey. I've learned that the sustainable way to live this life is in seasons – movement and stillness, exploration and integration, gathering stories and telling them.

I still don't have everything figured out. I still sometimes wonder if I should have kept that stable job. But then I remember sitting in Rodin's garden sketching roses, or watching the sun set over Lagos cliffs, or finishing a book at 3 AM with tears on my face, and I know I made the right choice.

This blog is my way of processing experiences, sharing discoveries, and inviting you into the ongoing adventure of learning to live fully. Thank you for being here and being part of the story.

### Let's Connect

I believe the best stories are the ones we share together. I'd love to hear from you.

What books are changing how you see the world? Where should I travel next? What are you noticing and appreciating today?
