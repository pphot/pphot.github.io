Welcome to Pphot, where I capture the art of paying attention.

This is my corner of the internet where I share stories from the road, reflections on books that have changed how I see the world, and photographs that celebrate the fleeting beauty all around us. What started five years ago as a one-way ticket and a camera has become a practice in presence – learning to notice, appreciate, and share the moments that make life worth living.

Here you'll find detailed travel journals from places that shaped me, in-depth book reviews that go beyond surface impressions, and golden hour photography that reminds us light transforms everything it touches.

I believe the examined life is worth the effort of examination. That beauty is abundant and free and happening right now, whether we're paying attention or not. That our stories connect us across the distances that separate us.

Join me in this ongoing adventure of learning to live fully, see clearly, and tell our stories with authenticity and heart.

*Life is a collection of moments. Let's make them count.*
