The Portuguese coast has a way of making you slow down. Maybe it's the sound of waves crashing against ancient cliffs, or the way the light turns everything golden in the late afternoon. Whatever it is, I found myself completely captivated.

## Lagos: Where Land Meets Sea

The Algarve region feels like nature's masterpiece. Towering rock formations rise from turquoise waters, creating secret beaches accessible only by boat or daring climbs. I spent hours exploring these hidden coves, camera in hand, trying to capture the interplay of light and shadow on the rust-colored cliffs.

Local fishermen taught me that the best seafood comes from knowing the tides. We shared grilled sardines and stories as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of pink and orange.

## Lisbon's Hills and History

In Lisbon, I lost count of how many hills I climbed. Each one offered a new perspective on this colorful city – pastel buildings stacked like building blocks, laundry hanging between balconies, tram lines cutting through narrow streets.

The most memorable moment? Getting completely lost in Alfama at dusk, only to stumble upon a tiny restaurant where an elderly woman sang fado so beautifully that time seemed to stop.

## Bringing Portugal Home

As I packed my bags, I realized I was taking more than souvenirs. Portugal taught me about living with warmth and authenticity, about finding beauty in simplicity, and about the art of truly being present.

Some places visit you as much as you visit them. Portugal is one of those places.

*Obrigada, Portugal, for the memories.* 🌊
