I've always loved Greek mythology, but the women in those stories were always secondary – mothers, lovers, victims, obstacles. Madeline Miller's "Circe" takes one of those secondary characters and asks: What if we told her story? What if we listened to her voice?

## The Witch Who Was Cast Out

Circe is the daughter of Helios the sun god and a nymph. She's born strange – not beautiful like her family, with a voice that sounds mortal rather than divine. She's mocked, dismissed, invisible. Sound familiar?

When she discovers she has power – the power of pharmakeia, witchcraft – she's immediately exiled to the island of Aiaia. The gods fear what they don't understand, so they banish it.

But exile becomes freedom. On her island, alone except for the occasional visitor (usually men who want to use her), Circe learns her craft. She becomes powerful not despite her isolation, but because of it.

## A Different Kind of Power

What struck me most about this book is how Miller reimagines power. Circe doesn't want to rule or conquer. She wants to understand, to create, to live on her own terms. Her magic isn't about domination – it's about transformation and protection.

The famous scene where she turns men into pigs? In Miller's retelling, it's self-defense against men who planned to assault her. The "monsters" she creates are her way of saying: leave me alone, I choose my solitude, you cannot take what I don't give.

## Immortality as Curse

The gods in this story are petty, cruel, bored. They've lived forever and nothing matters to them because nothing can truly change. They're stagnant.

Circe, in contrast, grows. She learns. She makes mistakes and regrets them. She changes her mind. She becomes more human, not less, over her thousands of years. And ultimately, she makes a choice that horrifies the gods but feels absolutely right: she chooses mortality.

Because what's the point of life without stakes? Without growth? Without the pressure of time making each moment matter?

## The Mother's Story

The middle section of the book, where Circe becomes a mother, completely gutted me. Her fierce, terrifying love for her son Telegonus. Her willingness to give up everything – her magic, her immortality, her freedom – to protect him.

And the devastating realization that you can't protect your children from everything. That part of loving them is letting them go into danger, into life, trusting you've prepared them well enough.

I'm not a mother, but I felt this in my bones. The specific terror of loving something you could lose.

## Meeting Herself

The most powerful moment in the book is when Circe meets Penelope – Odysseus's wife, the woman who waited twenty years for him to return. Two women who loved the same complicated man, who should be enemies, who instead recognize themselves in each other.

Two women who were underestimated, who survived through intelligence and stubbornness and will. Two women who were more than their relationships to men, even though that's how the myths remembered them.

Their friendship felt revolutionary. A quiet rewriting of competitive woman narratives into something truer and deeper.

## Miller's Writing

The prose is gorgeous – lyrical without being purple, mythic without being distant. Miller writes about immortal gods in a way that feels viscerally human. You feel Circe's loneliness, her rage, her love, her fear.

Every sentence feels intentional, weighted with meaning but never heavy. It's the kind of writing that makes you want to read passages aloud just to feel the words in your mouth.

## Why This Resonates

I think this book resonates because we all know what it's like to be underestimated, to be dismissed, to be punished for being different. We've all felt exiled in some way, sent to our own islands to figure ourselves out alone.

And we've all had to choose: do we let that exile define us, or do we use it to become who we're meant to be?

Circe chooses the latter. She becomes powerful not by becoming like the gods, but by becoming more fully herself. More mortal. More vulnerable. More human.

## Final Thoughts

This is a book about a woman finding her voice. About choosing solitude over bad company. About the kind of power that comes from within rather than being granted by others. About loving fiercely even when it hurts. About choosing your own story.

It's also a masterclass in reclaiming narratives. The myths told us Circe was a villain, a seductress, a minor obstacle in a man's journey. Miller tells us: no. She was the hero of her own story all along. We just weren't listening.
